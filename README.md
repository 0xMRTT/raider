A GUI for shred, a program in the GNU Coreutils

This program launches shred for each file loaded. So if you have a hundred files loaded, there would be a hundred instances of shred running at the same time. 
Luckily, shred not a intensive program, so you should not freeze your computer.

Right now this program is in very heavy development, so expect major changes. I plan to commit my changes on a weekly basis, but that may vary sometimes.
