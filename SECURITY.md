## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please email me at adbeveridge@protonmail.com.
Just describe the problem clearly, and expect a revision from between a week
or several months, depending on wether it is a bug in the interface, or if it
is a bug in the actual shredding program (which is `shred` by the way, which
is part of the GNU Coreutils).
